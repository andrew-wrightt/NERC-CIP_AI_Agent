# NERC-CIP_AI_Agent
This will serve as a repository for Capstone I/II at ASU. Our goal is to create an AI Agent that is self-hosted and uses RAG to help the team meet compliance standards, answer procedural questions, and generally help with day to day work. The agent will use a UI to interact with/adjust users and knowledge base.
